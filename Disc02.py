# Q10: Natural Chain

# For this problem, a chain_function is a higher order function 
# that repeatedly accepts natural numbers (positive integers).
# The first number that is passed into the function that chain_function
# returns initializes a natural chain, which we define as a consecutive
# sequence of increasing natural numbers (i.e., 1, 2, 3).
# A natural chain breaks when the next input differs from the expected
# value of the sequence. For example, the sequence (1, 2, 3, 5) is 
# broken because it is missing a 4.

# Implement the chain_function so that it prints out the value of the
# expected number at each chain break as well as the number of chain 
# breaks seen so far, including the current chain break. Each time the 
# chain breaks, the chain restarts at the most recently input number.

# For example, the sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 6) would only print 4 and 1. 
# We print 4 because there is a missing 4, and we print 1 because the 
# 4 is the first number to break the chain. The 5 broke the chain and 
# restarted the chain, so from here on out we expect to see numbers 
# increasingly linearly from 5. See the doctests for more examples. 
# You may assume that the higher-order function is never given numbers â‰¤ 0.
